Steps to create Factory

1 - Create Product interface --> It must contain the methods that all products must have.
2 - Create a concrete class for each type of Product --> They must implement the interface.
3 - Create the Factory class --> It must have a method that creates the new product.
4 - In the code that uses the products, we call the factory to create the product.


Here are some questions you should ask yourself if you are unsure whether or not to use the Factory design pattern:

- Are there different types of objects that need to be created?
- Do the objects need to be created based on user input?
- Do the objects need to be created based on system conditions?
- Do the objects need to be created based on the data that is available?
- Do the objects need to be created based on the system configuration?

If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, then the Factory design pattern may be a good option for you.
