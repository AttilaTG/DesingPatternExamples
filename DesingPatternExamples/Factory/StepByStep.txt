Steps to create Factory

1 - Create Product interface --> It must contain the methods that all products must have.
2 - Create a concrete class for each type of Product --> They must implement the interface.
3 - Create the Factory class --> It must have a method that creates the new product.
4 - In the code that uses the products, we call the factory to create the product.
